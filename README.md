# Dockerized Deepdream: Generate ConvNet Art in the Cloud

I utilized the digital ocean cloud to perform the generation of deep dreamed images. Below is the original documentation of the project whose groundinspiration was set by the team at VisionAI.

### My goals for this project were :
- To understand the intricacies of interactions between my local machine and a cloud instance.
- To successfully train novel images from my local machine on the neural network model that resides in the cloud.
- To connect the cloud instance to my github so I can share my results.

#### Here are some of the results I got.
